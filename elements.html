							<p>What is LISA?</p>
							<p>LISA, the listening agent, is a speculative chatbot, (a computer program that mimics conversation with people using artificial intelligence), with a visual and emotionally driven character.
								Its intention is to draw people into a conversation that stems from how they are doing at University and whether or not they are under pressure or stress. Simultasneously gathering the sentiment
								of the user deciding wether the tone of the conversation is postive or negative.  It explores its awareness and empathy can be nutured through such conversations, claiming these technologies
								for artistic production rather than commerical exploitation.</p>
							<p>LISA is created by Ryan Curnow BSc Internet Design at Plymouth University</p>
							<hr />
							<p>How does LISA work?</p>
							<p>LISA is designed to respond to users conversationally like a human to offer as a listening to post to young people and students.  So when you send LISA a message response, it processes this and generates
							a conversational response back to you.  LISA's response will be in the form of text.</p>
							<p>The information provided is used to determine a persons mood and whether or not the conversational agent is required to offer advice, none of the information provided is kept, and is deleted once the user
							exits the session.  This is done by analyzing the tone of the conversation being had with the chatbot using the IDM Watson™ Tone Analyzer service and Dialogflow™ natural language processor application.</p>
							<hr />
							<p>What is the purpose of LISA?</p>
							<p>The purpose of LISA is to determine to mood of each conversation it has, by analysing the tone of their conversations with the chatbot, (a computer program that mimics conversation with people using artificial intelligence). It speculated whether a chatbot with a visually driven character could engage and reflect the collective mood of the indivdual in real time. </p>
							<hr />
							<p>What made LISA?</p>
							<p>LISA is a technical project produced as part of a final year project by Ryan Curnow BSc Internet Design at Plymouth University.</p>
							<hr />
							<p>Is LISA human?</p>
							<p>No. LISA is an AI driven chatbot that uses conversational structures anc tone analysis to communicate.</p>
                            <hr />
							<p>How does LISA use my data?</p>
							<p>LISA attempts to understand the individuals mood through the users interaction with the chatbot.  This contributes to being able to provide a service to young people and students when struggling in social or academic situations.</p>
                            <p>Because of the nature of the project and the research built around anonymous community space the only data we would collect would be a username, no message or chat string will be collected as well as any data from IDM Watson™ tone analyser, to provide the best possible security to individuals using the service. Any interactions with the chatbot will be responded to in real time.</p>
                            <p>We will not give your information to third parties and will ensure this is only used for the above purpose and is kept securely.</p>
